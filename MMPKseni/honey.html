    <h1>Honey</h1>
    <p>
      “Well," said Pooh, "what I like best," and then he had to stop and think. Because although Eating Honey was a very good thing to do, there was a moment just before you began to eat it which was better than when you were, but he didn't know what it was called.”
<br> ― A.A. Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh
